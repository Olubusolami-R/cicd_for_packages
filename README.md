# Exploring CICD on Github 

This is a repo I used to practice how to set up and use Github pipelines.

The pipeline code is the .github/workflows directory (obviously).

It might be useful to you if you're trying to learn how to set up a Github pipeline that will publish and release packages/libraries.

Happy exploring!
